sort1 uses: bubble sort

How do you know?: it is bubble sort algorithm because it is using less running time for sorted data than sort3 as bubble sort
doesn't sort sorted data again and again

sort2 uses: merge sort

How do you know?: it is Merge sort algorithm
because even if the data gets bigger the running time is less than  sort1 and sort3
and the running time nearly same for both sorted and unsorted data.


sort3 uses: selection sort

How do you know?: it is selection sort algorithm because although it is taking similiar running time for unsorted data like bubble sort,
when it comes to sorted data again same long running time as other type of unsorted data.
